At state level, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria have been hit the hardest. The Australian Government has already promised more than $20 billion in stimulus to keep the Australian economy moving. However, this figure will need to continuously be raised to truly help the Australian economy recover from this devastating recession.",

Due to the social distancing rules set by the Australian government, most schools were forced to close their campuses and use an online platform to teach students.",

Within ten years, half of the company's 48,000 employees will work from home, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, after this extraordinary period, remote work is also expected to show a growth trend.",

Delivery staff would pick up the customers‚Äô orders and leave the takeaway at their front doors to effectively avoid face-to-face contact.",
                    "<strong>Movie/TV</strong> - Recently, Netflix stopped the production of many highly anticipated film and television productions such as the 4th season of Stranger Things. Warner Bros., Disney, and Apple Tv + have also stated that unless the pandemic is effectively controlled, many popular programs will be suspended. However, in contrast, as people spend more time indoors due to reduction in public events and gatherings, many online video platforms such as YouTube have increased popularity significantly.",
                    "<strong>Retail</strong> - During the spread of COVID-19, a large number of people in the Australian retail industry lost their jobs and consumer confidence dropped sharply. This eventually led to the collapse of many retail stores. However, at the same time, online retailers have seen some development. The number of online purchases increased for people over the age of 35 but there was a reduction in consumption for people under the age of 25. <em>‚ÄúOnline retail will be an indispensable solution for consumers‚Ä¶especially during this special period‚Äù</em> says Justin Dery, Doodle CEO Asia-Pacific."

This will continue and we will have to get used to a 'new normal', even if some restrictions are eased. Last week, each state premier of Australia announced new plans to reopen their jurisdiction.",
                    "The new plans contain further easing of restrictions will come into effect next week and the weeks ahead as the governments are under extreme financial pressure to reopen their economies.

This gives us more time to reflect and re-evaluate our lives. This gives an opportunity to reconnect and spend more time with family, friends, and partners. This taught us the value of money with the increment in job losses and more importantly, it taught us how precious and fragile our life is."

In April, Australian businesses shed 800,000 jobs, equating to 6% of the total workforce, with industries such as hospitality, travel, retail and accommodation among those taking the biggest hit. Simultaneously, some businesses have adapted in these uncertain times and are in high demand, including food delivery services, health, IT and postal services.",

This will save employers money on office space going forward and mean that the future of our workforce will have an increased emphasis on flexibility and work-life balance.",
                    "Another interesting factor to consider is decreased loyalty to an employer - a few decades ago, people used to stay in a job for life, whereas now, the average tenure of an Australian in a job is three years, and this will decrease as time goes by. A key question for many is - how do we ensure we‚Äôre available to take on various roles in a shorter period of time? One answer to this is online upskilling - many online courses, diplomas and degrees, have all had their prices slashed by 50% or more, so it‚Äôs an opportune time to learn and develop oneself.",

                    "The outbreak of COVID 19 has resulted in various impacts on the environment, and the climate as countries around the globe enforce strict lockdowns and allow limited commercial activities. Industries that generally produce a massive volume of carbon emission such as the aviation industry are forced to minimise their businesses under such global pandemic, which, in return, provides an opportunity for the earth to breathe. The severe decrease in planned travel through most means of transportation has resulted in a significant reduction in air pollution.",
                    "For example, lockdowns and other measures of restrictions for two months are directly responsible for the visible better air quality that visually demonstrates what 25% reduction in carbon emissions and 50% reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions mean. Wild animals are also spotted to breed and hang out in streets while humans are locked inside of their houses. However, we need to stay vigilant about making the assumption that the environment wins in this epidemic.",
                    "While the environments show signs of recovering from human activities in the last four months, the unrepairable disruptions and damage human impose on earth can be traced back from decades ago. The short-term reduce of carbon emission is barely as important as people think when the goal is to 'combat' global environmental challenges and climate change in the long run. Some people may blindly assume the solution to the environmental problems we face is stop focusing on economic growth and shutting down the fossil fuel-based economy as we did in this medical pandemic.",
                    "But, they neglected the fact that economic disruptions induced by the sudden change of economic model will impose a great threat on the social structure. There is no doubt billions of population will be jobless in an immediate economic transformation with no realisable technologies that could support it. Moreover, as seen in the 2008-2009 financial crash that resulted in a significant drop in global emission for a year-long, the overall global anthropogenic emissions quickly rebounded back by 2010 as the economy recovers where the emission that year landed on an all-time high. Hence, it is clear that such practices are neither desirable nor sustainable.",
                    "On the bright side, the COVID-19 pandemic does provide us with an opportunity to promote long-term environmental sustainability. As supported by various academics in the sustainability studies, a critical factor that could lead to environmental sustainability is by people practising pro-environment behaviours. COVID-19 crisis has forced billions of people to alter their behaviours in significant ways. Luckily, a lot of these habitual behaviours are deemed good for the environment.",
                    "Overall, the global response to COVID-19 has already shown exhibiting environmental benefits for the past months. But the question of whether these pro-environment practices can be carried on after the pandemic is gone depends on if individually and collectively we are willing to make these changes."

For those in high risk groups such as those aged under 5 or over 65, the flu vaccine is fully funded by the government. For anyone else, the flu vaccine costs roughly $15-20, and can be administered at most pharmacies.",

Getting vaccinated will help protect yourself and others, as well as help reduce the impact on our already stretched healthcare system.",

Additionally, another <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036673v2'>recent publication</a> indicated that a concentration of 70% ethanol was adequate to deactivate the virus.",

What is the difference between wearing a surgical mask compared to cloth masks? Out of all these interventions - which one is the best? A lack of clarity in public health announcements is often because evidence-based guidelines on these matters often do not reach a consensus after systemic evaluation and studies into these strategies are often too dispersed and unregulated to result in clear outcomes.

                    "Of the most pressing concern for other studies, is to evaluate whether or not face masks should be used as a non-therapeutic intervention. This comes from the many discrepancies about the usage of face masks from different authorities. While the use of surgical masks has been promoted in Asian countries, the World health organization, Europe and North America do not promote this practice. Some including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina, and Australia however, have changed their recommendations. The following article provides an extensive systematic review of the current literature regarding facemasks, with an effective overview of how masks' effectiveness changes depending on the setting (household, facemasks), effectiveness in community settings and mass gatherings, and how it can interfere with ordinary activities <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1.full.pdf'><small class='cite'>[1]</small></a>.",

The first possible way is exploring ways to disinfect used masks, so they can be reused. Some of these studies examine cheap, easily deployable disinfection practices <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050443v2.full.pdf'><small class='cite'>[1]</small></a>.

                    "While there does seem to be some amount of studies being published in regards to non-therapeutic interventions, we can always do better and in many cases, it is still not enough. Here are some of the key limitations we believe might be missing from the picture.",
                    "Firstly, we need to determine how major non-intervention strategies in middle and low-income countries prevent disease. Some studies are already in place, for example, estimation studies in Colombia <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20063727v2.full.pdf'><small class='cite'>[1]</small></a>. The validity of these studies, however, is coupled with problems due to poor testing capabilities, and the possible real number of cases can be estimated through other methods such as assessing sewage systems for COVID-19 particles. ",
                    "Most studies currently are either experimental or observational, and there are no random clinical trials (RCT) to assess the effectiveness of these measures. The most pressing gaps in knowledge that are coming from this epidemic, is our lack of consensus about the validity of masks. However aside from assessing masks and their use in curbing COVID-19 infections, there are also numerous other that deserve attention, such as handwashing and eye protection equipment. What are some alternatives if these resources are not available? What resources can be provided to individuals with allergies to the product used? What are the consequences of wearing these equipment long term? ",
                    "Aside from addressing new questions, it is important to note that, conducting poor quality RCT after pandemics had been a recurring pattern. A new systematic study<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2.full.pdf'><small class='cite'>[1]</small></a> assesses the validity of randomized clinical trials conducted in relation to influenza and influenza-like illness after the 2003 SARS epidemic. Of over 2000 clinical trials, all but 100 were immediately omitted from the assessment. Of these 100 studies, there was no significant effect on the use of almost every non-therapeutic intervention which included masks, handwashing, eye protection for influenza. This does not suggest nothing we do actually but helps us, but highlights that much of studies till now have been too low quality and messy to allow us to drive any positive  conclusions.",
                    "So how would we correct the mistakes from the past? It has been suggested one possible way would be to have  more transparency in randomized clinical trials in regards to non-therapeutic interventions. This in fact is a very broad problem in which all trials performed under any context, aside from vaccines or drugs have been poorly regulated, and they require registration in most countries, especially in the US and EU. Transparency in what studies have been conducted is the first step towards standardising the way these trials are conducted <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h1323.abstract'><small class='cite'>[1]</small></a>. Perhaps, with the number of new dashboard technologies that could be utilised to monitor and track upcoming trials, similar to those proposed for important clinical trials.",
                    "Aside from randomised clinical trials, what can we do to improve observational studies? Since these studies analyse patterns in data, after the event has passed, documented case information is important. However, the government and others globally provide clear uniform ways of updating case numbers, without consistencies between every province and country. Typically researchers judge the specific material used for protective coverings from government directions and also pictures of the public and what a majority uses. Explicit, direct instructions on how to implement interventions would also be appreciated, such that there is less guessing work. ",
                    "Lastly, research on the best way to educate and inform the public on how to comply with non-intervention measures as well as the importance of these measures, is heavily needed. We did not come across any of these studies in the current pre-prints, but this is a critical factor especially in countries where there might be poor literacy, as well as to educate and take care of those in the public who might be unable to understand these guidance due to different restrictions.",

With this in mind, the development of rapid test kits or point of care tests could pave the way for widespread, on-the-spot testing. This will not only allow us to get a far more accurate picture of the number of active cases, but also will facilitate the tracing of cases and allow essential workers the peace of mind to know when they can return to work and their families if isolating.",
